# Graph Data-Structure
### A graph data structure is a non linear data structure that consists of vertices and edges.
## Vertices :
### Vertices are also known as nodes. It is the fundamental unit of graph and it contains the actual data.
## edges:
### Edge is the connection between two vertices(nodes).

#### Graphs are used to present many real world scenarions like the Graph of internet. It is use for solving real world problems.

## Types: 
### Weighted, Unweighted, directed and undirected are the four maain types of graphs. In Weighted graphs every edge have a weidge attached and in directed graphs vertices points to other vertices(directed graphs can only be treversed in the direction of the vertice). Vertices in Undirected graphs can be traversed in bi directios , also weight is applieed to both directions(if the graph is weighted).
