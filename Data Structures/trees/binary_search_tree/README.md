# Binary-Search-Tree (BST)
### A binary-search-tree is a node based binary tree, following the two propeties. 1). The left child node is smaller than the parent node. 2). The right child node is equal to or greater than the parent node 

## Due to partially sorted BST are used for fast lookups, deletions and insertions.

## Balanced BInary Trees have Insertion, Deletion and Searching of O(log n)
## Unbalanced BST have worst case of O(n) operations for Insertions, Deletion and lookup (Searching).

## Self balancnig binary trees are called AVL-tree.

## BST Opertations
### Search
#### Searches an element in a tree.

### Insert −
#### Inserts an element in a tree.

### Pre-order Traversal −
#### Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

### In-order Traversal − 
#### Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

### Post-order Traversal −
#### Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.

## Note: - To Implement Binary Search Tree we can create a new class. In our code we will be using the BinaryTreeNode.dart class
