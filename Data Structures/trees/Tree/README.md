# Trees
### Tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Trees are used for storing hierarchical data, like folder structure. Each Node in a tree keep data and track of childern(refrence to childern).A tree Node can have a single or multiple child but each tree node must have only one parent.


### Tree data structure common terminologies

## Root
## The very top most node in a tree is called root (or root node). Root has no parent.

## Parent
### Every node is connected to a single node that is one level above. This node (one level above ) is called the parent node.

## Child
### The current node refrenced nodes are called its childern.

## Leaf 
### A node is a leaf if it has no childern

### Note:
#### There will be a lot of recursions  used in the operations relataed to tree data structures. Everything that can be done through recursion can be done through Iteration.
#### Every Iterative method can be Implementd through recurson .
#### I have used recursive methods cause iteration can be more copmlex and jumbled in the operations related to tree data structures.
