# Binary-Tree
### A non-linear (Tree) Data structure in which every node has at the most two childern.
### Childern of the the binary-tree are called left and right childern.

## Binary Tree Opertations
### Search
#### Searches an element in a tree.

### Insert −
#### Inserts an element in a tree.

### Pre-order Traversal −
#### Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

### In-order Traversal − 
#### Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

### Post-order Traversal −
#### Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.

#### Note : - Binary Tree are un sorted so all traversals, insertions are O(n) operations. It mean we have to look through every node to perform action on the desired node
