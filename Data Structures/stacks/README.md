# Stack 

### Stack is a linear data structure that follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Stack data structures resembles the real world stack (like stack of Papers, stack of Plates or stack of tiles).

## Push 
### Push method is use for inserting an element at the top of a stack.

## Pop
### Pop is used for removing an element from the top of the stack.

## isEmpty 
### It is used to check if the stack is empty 

## peek 
### peek is used to get the top element of the stack

### We can use linked list and Arrays (Dart List ) for implementing Stacks data structures.

## ** We cannot insert element at random position inside stack, that is against the stack ADT rules. **
