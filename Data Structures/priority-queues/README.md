# Priority-Queue

### Priorit-Queue is a type of queue in which elements are 'deQueue ' on the basis of Priority (Not in FIFO order).

### There are two types of priority queues: 1) Min Prioriy Queue. 2) Max Priority Queue

## Min Priority Queue:
### In Min Priority queue the element in the front is always the smallest

## Max Priority Queue: 
### In Max Priority queue the element in the front is always the greatest.

#### Note : Priority Queues can be implemented by using Linked-List, Sorted Arrays (Dart Lists), balanced-binary-search tree and Heaps.In this repo Priority queue will be implemented by using Heaps Data Structure. We will create a layer of abstraction over Heaps only focusing on the key operations like Queue, Dequeue , getting Peek etc.
