# Queues

### Queue is a data structues that is open at both ends, but elemnts can only be added at the back and can be removed from the front. Queue follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In real world a line of people at boarding waiting for getting in plane or waiting for getting a ticket is the queue.

## enqueue 
### Enqueuing is the insertion of element at the Start(End) of of the Queue

## Dequeue
### Dequeuing is the removal of element from the very last(front) of the the queue.
 
## Peek
### Peek returns the very first element of the queue .

## isEmpty 
### isempty checks the queue if it is empty

### Note: 
#### We can implement queue by using lists, Double (two) stacks, Doubly Linked List etc .. All different implementations have different Time and Space complexities. So queues should be implemented accourding to the needs(use case).
