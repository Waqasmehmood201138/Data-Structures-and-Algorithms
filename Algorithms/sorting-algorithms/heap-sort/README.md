# Heap-Sort Algorithm
### Heap-Sort is a comparison based algorithm that is based on Heap data structure.

## In Max-Heap the root node is the largest.
## In Min-Heap the root node is the smalles.

### This algorithm repeatedly remove the highest priority value from the heap.
### Time complexity of heap-sort is O(n log n) and space complexity of O(n)
