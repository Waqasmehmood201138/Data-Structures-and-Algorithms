# Merge-Sort
### Merge-Sort algorithm is a comparison based sorting algorithm that uses the technique of Devide and Conquer
### Merge sort algorithm first devides and the merge that devided items in sorted order.  

### The time complexity of merge sort is reduced to O(n log n), which is way more efficient than the  Bubble-Sort, Insertion-Sort and Selection-sort, But this efficiency is traded of for a space complexity of O ( n log n). The algorithms that have the time complexity of O(n^2) have the space complexity of O(1).
### Somtimes we have to sacrifice RAM (space) and somtimes when space is limited than we have to sacrific Time.
