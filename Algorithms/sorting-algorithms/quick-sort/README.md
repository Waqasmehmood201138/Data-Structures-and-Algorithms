# Quick-Sort 
### Quick-Sort Algorithm is a comparison based algoritm that uses the technique of devide and conquer . This algorithm selects a pivot point in a list and than devide the list into three sublist , then right and the left sub list  and the pivot list(contains the values equal to the pivot). 
## Complexity: 
### Time complexity of quick-sort is O(n log n). 
## Selecting the pivt point:
### Selection of the pivot point is very important. We can use multiple starategies while selecting the Pivot-point. 
### The pivot point can be the first element , the last element or the median of the list.The median of the list is the median of the  list lowest , list heghest and the list middle element(value). The most efficient one is the median  . 
### For selection of median we have , Hoare’s Partitioning, Lomuto’s Algorithm and Dutch-National-Flag partioning.
