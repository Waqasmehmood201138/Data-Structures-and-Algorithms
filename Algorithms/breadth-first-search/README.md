# Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
## This Algorithm traverses or searches the closest vertices from the starting vertex before going deep. In Trees Data-Structures we called it Level Order Traversal.

### BFS is mostly use to find the shortest path . It can also be used for friends suggestion on social media app

### BFS is O(n) operations in worst case.
