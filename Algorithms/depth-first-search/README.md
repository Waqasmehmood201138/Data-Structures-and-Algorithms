# Depth-First-Search (DFS) Travesal .
## In DFS we starts at root node and goes as far as possible at each branch before back tracking.

## Uses 
### DFS is used for finding the path from start to end. It is also used fordetecting cycles in graphs.
### DFS uses Stack data stracture for keeping track of the vertices. BFS is considerd fast due to fast Push and Pop operatioons of stacks.
